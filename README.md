**🚗 AutoPark32 – Smart Parking System with Dual Cloud Integration & Dynamic Pricing (ML-Based)**



This project simulates a smart parking system using ESP32 (Wokwi) to monitor slot availability and leverages MQTT, ThingSpeak, and AWS IoT Core for cloud integration. It features dynamic pricing powered by machine learning, responsive dashboards, and scalable data routing—all without the need for physical hardware.

**📌 Features**
🔄 Real-time parking slot detection (1 = Occupied, 0 = Available)
📡 MQTT data publishing via HiveMQ (test.mosquitto.org)
🌐 Dual cloud routing:
🛰️ ThingSpeak: Visualization + API data stream
☁️ AWS IoT Core: Enterprise-grade handling via Python MQTT bridge
🧠 ML-based dynamic pricing algorithm
⚛️ ReactJS frontend for real-time dashboard and pricing display
🧪 Wokwi simulator—fully hardware-free testing

**🧠 ML-Driven Dynamic Pricing**
Our machine learning model adjusts pricing based on:
Current parking occupancy
Historical slot usage patterns
Time of day and availability trends
This allows demand-based real-time pricing similar to modern smart city systems.
